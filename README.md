GAME INFO:
------------------
Title: Cupid's Arrow

Description: Cupid's Arrow is a 2D top down shooter. You are Cupid and your mission is to spread love to the sad people who have a gloomy, blue aesthetic, that wander the map, shoot your way into their hearts and bring back joy into their lives. The map is a simple pink grassland, surrounded by a dark maroon barrier with gaps, so the sad people can enter the map to walk towards Cupid.

Instructions: In the beginning of the game, you are in the center of the map and slowly the people will enter the world, it's your goal as Cupid to go around shooting them with your arrows until their blue-like appearance matches your own; pink, vibrant and happy. In the corner of the game, there is a score board which will track the amount of people you have helped, with each person you bring joy to, you recieve 100 points in return.

WHAT I LEARNED + MOST PROUD OF:
----------------------------
From designing and working a lot with new coding with this project, I learnt how different coding worked and became more familiar and comfortable with working with it. I had spent a good amount of hours working on different parts of my game and with enough patience and slowly understanding the concept on how things worked, I was awarded with a fully functional game which I'm very proud of.
